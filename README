microwatt source repository.

There are two build configurations:
itrv
gateway

In order to swap between the two
Right click on project "microwatt" then:
Build Configurations->Set Active

You will also require the simiplicit code from TI.

I have this in:

https://github.com/acrawford78/microwatt_simpliciti

Extract or clone to:

G:\ti\msp430\SimpliciTI_CCS_1_1_1_5xx

(probably change the G: to C:)

The location of the is has to be specified in:

Properties->linked resources "path variables"

DEV_ROOT
G:\ti\msp430\SimpliciTI_CCS_1_1_1_5xx

Change this to where you extracted SimpliciTI_CCS_1_1_1_5xx

On how to re-add the simpliciti to project.

I use the lastest code composer studio v5, appears to be much better than previous versions
